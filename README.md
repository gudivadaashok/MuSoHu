# MuSoHu: Multi-Modal Social Human Navigation (v2)

Multi-Modal Social Human Navigation Dataset - A robotics research platform developed at George Mason University for collecting data on human-robot interactions in social navigation contexts.

**Project Website:** [https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/Research/MuSoHu/](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/Research/MuSoHu/)

## About

This project collects social human navigation data in natural human-inhabited public spaces. An egocentric data collection sensor suite worn by walking humans captures multi-modal robot perception data.

### Dataset Scale
- **~100 km** of navigation data
- **20 hours** of recording
- **300 trials** across various environments
- **13 human** participants
- Multiple public spaces with natural social navigation interactions

## Multi-Modal Sensor Suite

The wearable data collection device includes:

- **3D LiDAR** - Robosense Helios 32 (360° environmental scanning)
- **Stereo & Depth Camera** - Stereolabs ZED 2i (visual perception and depth sensing)
- **IMU** - Inertial Measurement Unit (motion tracking)
- **Odometry/Actions** - Online processing for human navigation behavior extraction
- **Microphone Array** - Seeed Studio ReSpeaker Mic Array (spatial audio capture)
